# Windows-11-Compatibility-Checker
Checks if your system meets the requirements of Windows 11.

This app features a better UI than WhyNotWin11.

If you don't trust me you can decompile the app, it's not obfuscated. Also, f you Microsoft for flagging this as malware but refusing to add the PanOS malware to your db.

**Requirements**
- .NET Framework 4.0 or later
- Windows 10 or later

**Known issues**
- This app may take quite some time to launch. That's because it checks before the window opens
- App will crash on Windows XP and Windows 7

**To-do list**
- Add TPM checker
- Add screen res checker

If you run this on Windows 11, you'd get a friendly message
