# Windows-11-Compatibility-Checker
Checks if your system meets the requirements of Windows 11.
This app features a better UI than WhyNotWin11.
If you don't trust me you can decompile the app, it's not obfuscated

**Requirements**
- .NET Framework 4.0 or later
- Windows XP or later I assume, only tested it on Windows 10

**Known issues**
- This app may take quite some time to launch. That's because it checks before the window opens

**To-do list**
- Add TPM checker
- Add screen res checker

If you run this on Windows 11, you'd get a friendly message
